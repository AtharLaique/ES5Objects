         -> With the help of the class, we can create the same multiple objects by writing code 
            only a single time, but using Object to make the same multiple objects is very difficult 
            because then we write the same code for all the objects.
         -> We can add properties in the object at any time, but in class, we can't.
         -> To make a class we write a function that is actually a constructor function.
