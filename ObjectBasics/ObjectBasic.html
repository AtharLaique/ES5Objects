        -> We know that javascript is a function-oriented language.
           And we also know that everything in a javascript must have a type 
           because they inherited from some class/function.
        -> Just like every other language, javascript also has a top-level class/function 
            with the name of the Object.
        -> In JS, there is no 'class or struct' construct to create a Class.
        -> Object is directly created and properties/functions are added.

            /*--------------------Adding properties using array method-------------------------
             -> Objects are associative arrays.
             -> Associative arrays, also called maps or dictionaries, are an abstract data type that can 
                hold data in (key, value) pairs.
